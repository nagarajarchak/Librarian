# Librarian: A Library Database Management System

### Library /ˈlʌɪbrəri,ˈlʌɪbri/
(*noun*)
a building or room containing collections of books, periodicals, and sometimes films and recorded music for use or borrowing by the public or the members of an institution.

This is a simple library DBMS developed to enhance the overall customer experience at a library by reducing paper work, simplifying registration, borrowing, returning process and provide a convenient information retrieval process, all of which is done in order to enable a pleasant and quality reading time. Features of this DBMS are listed below:

- Borrow/Return.
- Add/Search/Delete.
- Membership Registration.
- User & Admin View.

The backend code is structured using classes, structures and data is stored in binary files. The DBMS is an interactive platform with minimal frontend design. Arrow keys are used for navigation.

### Here are a few screenshots of the system:

*I found the code for this project while recovering files from my old computer. This was a DBMS project that I had developed as part of CBSE Grade 12 CS project work in 2014.* :grin:
